Board revision notes from group for further revision: 
-Change angle of run to portal to alley (run towards camera looks awkward)
-Staging after ally portal too comedic, add in close up/upshot and then close up downshot of spikes
-add long shot to building portal scene
-have tree arm grab several times
-remove potoos, replace with axolotadiles
-forego thorn cave scene
-have Laila run after kerfluffle instead of calmly walking after it.
