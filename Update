So, for this project I am currently still working on the axolotadile model and the sborse model. This project has also kind of turned into creating 3D assets for different game project. Right now I have a sword, shield, beehive, sling, scroll, slingshot Bedouin tent, UI for a main menu, UI for a tutorial menu, three different 2D fire animations, and I'm currently working on other 2D effects animations. I'm not sure I can put those assets up online since they are for a project owned by an actual company, but I can take screenshots for everything I've worked on for it, it that's okay.
